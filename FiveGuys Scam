<h1>FiveGuys Phishing Attempt IRR</h1>
<p>On 23AUG2021 we were contacted by Ellie Russintino about a possible incident involving a store manager for one of our customers FiveGuys. The customer, Ivan, submitted a ticket with his organization which then got escalated to us. Ivan was contacted, via phone, by someone claiming to be Gustav Medina that was from Brink and worked with DeAnna Cruz.</p>
<p>DeAnna is one of the technical support agents that was working with Ivan on replacing two of his terminals that are under warranty.</p>
<p>This Gustav contacted Ivan via his personal cell phone saying that he is shipping the terminals to his store and that Ivan would have to have about $4k ready in cash in order to receive the registers. Added to this a lady claiming to be named Stephanie contacted Ivan as well and said that she was the FedEx store manager in his area. It appeared these individuals were part of a team and trying to run the scam together.</p>
<p>Ivan started getting suspicious when they asked for cash, so he got them on the phone and said “hold on let us join my PAR Customer Service Rep that is working this case”. Upon learning that he was going to add DeAnna to the call they hung up immediately and never called again.</p>
<h1>Remediation</h1>
<p>Looking through the accounts of involved PAR individuals we quickly were able to confirm that their accounts have not been compromised. This only shows the importance of not only educating our employees but also our partners and customers that we interact with to help protect them.</p>
